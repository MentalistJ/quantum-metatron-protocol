### Description of Invention

The QuantumMetatron protocol introduces a novel method for protecting
user privacy when interacting with large language model (LLM) services:

1. **QuantumMetatron (q_metatron.py)**
   Session-scoped HMAC token substitution table where each word in a
   user message is replaced by a deterministic but unrecognisable token
   derived from the session key. The LLM receives obfuscation instructions
   and must decode tokens before responding. Response integrity is verified
   via a session-scoped ACK marker.

2. **MetatronSplitter (q_metatron_splitter.py)**
   Round-robin distribution of semantic tokens across N independent LLM
   providers, such that no single provider receives more than 1/N of the
   original message content. Providers run in parallel (asyncio), and
   responses are assembled locally. An optional local LLM (Ollama) acts
   as assembler, synthesising partial responses without having seen the
   original query.

### Novelty

As of 2026-02-24, no published academic paper, patent, or commercial
product implements the combination of:
  - Session-scoped HMAC token tables for LLM prompt obfuscation
  - Multi-provider semantic split for distributed privacy
  - Local LLM-based response assembly
  - Integration with cryptographic session chains (QuantumSnap)

## QuantumSnap Protocol

**Protocol:** QuantumSnap — Forward-Secrecy SSE Authentication
**Author:** Paulo Jonathan Oliveira (MentalistJ)
**Date:** 2026 (see git history)

HMAC-SHA256 forward-chain per SSE packet, NFT-identity-based session
bootstrapping, O(1) memory server-side verification, and heartbeat-based
revocation cascade. Combined with on-chain NFT identity (QuantumNFT,
