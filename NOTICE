### Description of Invention

The QuantumMetatron protocol introduces a novel method for protecting
user privacy when interacting with large language model (LLM) services:

1. **QuantumMetatron (q_metatron.py)**
   Session-scoped HMAC token substitution table where each word in a
   user message is replaced by a deterministic but unrecognisable token
   derived from the session key. The LLM receives obfuscation instructions
   and must decode tokens before responding. Response integrity is verified
   via a session-scoped ACK marker.

2. **MetatronSplitter (q_metatron_splitter.py)**
   Round-robin distribution of semantic tokens across N independent LLM
   providers, such that no single provider receives more than 1/N of the
   original message content. Providers run in parallel (asyncio), and
   responses are assembled locally. An optional local LLM (Ollama) acts
   as assembler, synthesising partial responses without having seen the
   original query.

3. **MetatronSplitterSemantic (q_metatron_splitter_semantic.py)**
   Uses a lightweight local/cheap LLM (e.g. DeepSeek) to semantically
   decompose the user message into independent conceptual fragments, which
   are then HMAC-obfuscated and dispatched in parallel across N cloud
   providers. The assembler synthesises responses locally.

4. **QuantumDanceAssembler (q_quantum_dance.py)**  
   Rotating cloud assembler layer that operates after the split. Instead of
   always using the same provider to synthesise partial responses, it selects
   a cloud assembler pseudo-randomly per call, with a configurable non-repeat
   window derived from the session key. An optional local guard (Ollama)
   must return PASS_TOKEN before the assembled response is accepted; if it
   returns REWORK_TOKEN, a local fallback assembler is tried. The assembler
   never receives the original query — only the partial responses.

### Novelty

As of 2026-02-24 (MetatronSplitter) / 2026-02-27 (QuantumDance), no published
academic paper, patent, or commercial product implements the combination of:
  - Session-scoped HMAC token tables for LLM prompt obfuscation
  - Multi-provider semantic split for distributed privacy
  - Rotating cloud assembler with per-session non-repeat window
  - Local LLM guard with PASS_TOKEN / REWORK_TOKEN protocol
  - Integration with cryptographic session chains (QuantumSnap)

## QuantumSnap Protocol

**Protocol:** QuantumSnap — Forward-Secrecy SSE Authentication
**Author:** Paulo Jonathan Oliveira (MentalistJ)
**Date:** 2026 (see git history)

HMAC-SHA256 forward-chain per SSE packet, NFT-identity-based session
bootstrapping, O(1) memory server-side verification, and heartbeat-based
revocation cascade. Combined with on-chain NFT identity (QuantumNFT,
QuantumHash, QuantumShield contracts on Sepolia testnet).
